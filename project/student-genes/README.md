This folder contains selected students' analyses of genes. I selected ones that are either excetionally well analyzed, or really interesting to me despite caveats in the analysis. Below are the list of projects included:

| Student name | Project theme | Gene name | Gene (putative) function |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Waheed Awotoye | antifungal resistance (echinocandin) | FKS1 | Glucan synthase |
