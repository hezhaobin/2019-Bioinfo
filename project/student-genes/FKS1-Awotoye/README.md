# Title: A 8-Amino Acid Residue Insertion may be Associated with Pathogenicity and Antifungal drug resistance in Candida auris

## INTRODUCTION

_Candida auris_ is pathogenic fungi whose global concern is growing rapidly. This is due to the fatality of the infection and resistance to many antifungal drugs. One of the newer antifungals is Echinocandin which inhibits beta-glucan synthase, an enzyme involved in the cell wall synthesis of the fungi. Isolates of _Candida auris_ have shown resistance to this new drug. One protein that has been implicated is *FKS1*[1](#_ENREF_1). Mutation in *FKS1* has been reported to be
associated with Echinocandin-resistant _Candida albicans_ and _Candida glabrata_. Our table chose to understand the phylogeny of this gene/protein. Understanding the phylogeny of this protein can give an insight into the evolution pattern of _Candida auris_ (strains). The aim of this study is to determine of the evolution pattern of _Candida auris_ based on the phylogeny of the gene/protein of interest and possibly infer the ancestry of the organism.
