This is Patrick's ABC transporter family. I was originally planning to perform reconciliation for his gene family, as the evolutionary history of this family appears very complex and interesting. Upon further looking, the gene sequence file needs extensive editing to make the species name and gene names conforming to the same standard, so that the gene tree can be reconciled with the species tree. I'm leaving the result as is for later review. I feel like someone could dig into this gene family more deeply and may find very interesting things.
