BLAST database
To recreate the database with genome sequences in fasta format, follow the following example
```
gunzip -c ../../data/C.auris/Cand_auris_B11221_V1/Cand_auris_B11221_V1_genomic.fna.gz | makeblastdb -in - -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl -title Cand_auris_B11221_V1_genomic -out Cand_auris_B11221_V1_genomic
```

I added a new database, from a concatenated fasta that combines all the fasta files for genomic DNA from the species/strains sequenced in the MuÃ±oz paper.

```
gunzip -c ../data/GenBank/C_auris_clade_genomic.fna.gz | makeblastdb -in - -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl -title C_auris_clade_genomic -out C_auris_clade_genomic
```

I noticed that the total number of sequences added to the blast database, as reported by the `makeblastdb` command output, is smaller than the total number of sequences as found by `grep -c "^>" xxx.fna.gz`. I'm not sure why.

To actually perform a blast search, use the following command
```
blastn -db Cd_auris_B11221_V1_genomic -query efg1.fa -out results.out
```
